title: "Interested in IT"
---

The begins of an interest in IT was in the hardware sector. I like computers since I was young because of that, I was used to purchasing products like CPU GPU and assembling computers. However, while continuing to hear the news that leading it in the future is the software sector, not the hardware sector, news that Softbank acquired  ARM Hoardings which is a smartphone processor maker in 2016 at an unprecedented price has decisively boosted my interest in IT for software such as database and IoT.

Realizing that this place has a good facility with passionate instructors while on the RMIT English course, I decided to learn at RMIT Vietnam first before going to RMIT Australia, which has the merit of being the same country Australian TAFE facility.

I am looking forward to identifying appropriate jobs for me that related to IT and learning background information about IT.
