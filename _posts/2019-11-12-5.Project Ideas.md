The database administrator seems to be a suitable job for me. This job requires knowledge such as IT, analysis, computer science, and certification of programming languages for instance, Microsoft SQL and IBM DB2, for the main task of building, designing and managing databases.

This job is a highly demanding and well-paid job because it is suitable for the recent trend of using databases in most business organizations. Besides, it is an attractive job for me personally due to the mathematical field is my most capable and favorite area.

As a plan for this job, firstly, I will take a bachelor's degree for IT at RMIT VN for about a year to learn basic knowledge, and then I will have a database administrator course at TAFE institution in Australia to get a diploma degree. Finally, I will finish my bachelor's degree at RMIT Au.
