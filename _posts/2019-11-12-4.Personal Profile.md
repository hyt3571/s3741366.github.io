According to the learning style test, learning by hands-on experience and activity is, which called kinesthetic learning, an optimal style for me. It means that participating and devoting as much as possible to the tasks which I am working on and the activities that available to me will assist educationally the most.


Creativity test estimates that I tend to look at it from different perspectives and think in unique or innovative methods rather than to find its connection based on a large amount of information or facts. It confirms that I'm optimized for developing and advancing work rather than go toward basic and traditional work.


MBTI test revealed that I am INTP-A, which means a person who is logical and dogmatic. INTP is the type where reason comes before emotion, it tends to make the most logical decisions within the information it has. Furthermore, INTP tends to solve alone everything and this is the biggest drawback which is the opposite attitude for the desirable college life.


In summing up these characteristics, it is appropriate to analyze as well as organize the work and propose new ideas to the team. Besides, to overcome the weakness of being dogmatic, actively communicate with team members is essential.


Since leadership is insufficient, recruit the person who will manage and coordinate team members is necessary to make the team. Also, it may create synergistic effects with a passionate person who enough to implement the theories and ideas.
